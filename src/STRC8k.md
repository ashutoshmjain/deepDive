# Quantitative Validation of the Strategy Inc. Structural Floor: A Technical Assessment of STRC Principal Protection and the USD 8,000 Bitcoin Solvency Model

The financial architecture of Strategy Inc. (formerly MicroStrategy Incorporated) represents the first global implementation of a "Bitcoin Development Company" treasury model. Moving into 2026, the company has successfully transitioned its balance sheet into a "digital fortress" supported by a tiered hierarchy of long-dated convertible debt, perpetual preferred equity, and a significant USD liquidity reserve. Central to this architecture is the "structural floor"—the price point at which the company’s Bitcoin treasury fully covers its senior-most obligations.
This technical paper analyzes the solvency of Strategy Inc. through a catastrophic stress test, evaluating whether the flagship Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock (STRC) remains protected even if the underlying Bitcoin asset collapses to USD 8,000.

## The Tiered Digital Credit Ecosystem

Strategy Inc. utilizes a "Bitcoin-backed yield curve" to attract diverse capital providers. Unlike traditional corporate debt, the firm’s mezzanine layer consists primarily of perpetual preferred shares (tickers: STRF, STRC, STRK, STRD, and STRE). These instruments are permanent capital—they have no mandatory redemption date, which eliminates the risk of a "maturity wall" forcing Bitcoin liquidations during cyclical bear markets.

| Security Class | Ticker | Priority | Yield Mechanism | Stated/Par Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Perpetual Strife | STRF | Senior Preferred | 10% Fixed | USD 100 |
| Perpetual Stretch | STRC | Mezzanine | 11.25% Variable; Monthly Cash | USD 100 |
| Perpetual Strike | STRK | Mezzanine | 8% Fixed; Convertible at USD 1,000 | USD 100 |
| Perpetual Stride | STRD | Junior Preferred | 10% Non-Cumulative | USD 100 |
| Common Stock | MSTR | Junior-most | Residual Equity Upside | N/A |

### The Liquidity Pillar: Dividend Sustainability

As of early February 2026, Strategy Inc. maintains a USD 2.25 billion USD cash reserve. This reserve serves as a firewall, ensuring the company can meet its recurring obligations without selling Bitcoin holdings.
The company’s total annual interest and dividend liability stands at USD 888 million, broken down as follows:

* **Convertible Debt Interest:** ~USD 35 million (weighted average cost of 42 basis points).
* **Cumulative Preferred Dividends:** ~USD 713 million (covering STRF, STRC, STRK, and STRE).
* **Non-Cumulative Dividends:** ~USD 140 million (covering STRD).

Given these consolidated obligations, the mathematical runway provided by the cash reserve is:
This validates management’s guidance of "more than 2.5 years of coverage," providing a multi-year buffer to wait for market recovery.

## Strategic Debt Equitization: Institutional Drivers

A cornerstone of Strategy Inc.’s 2026 survival plan is the equitization of approximately USD 6 billion in convertible debt over the next three to six years. This strategy transforms senior creditors into common shareholders, significantly de-leveraging the balance sheet.

### bondholder Incentives for Conversion

While debt-to-equity swaps typically involve trade-offs, bondholders in 2026 face a unique opportunity to convert into MSTR equity due to three specific factors:
**1. The NAV Discount Opportunity** Historically, MSTR has traded at a significant premium to its Net Asset Value (mNAV > 1). However, as of February 2026, the multiple-to-NAV has declined toward 1.10, and in some sessions, the company's total market capitalization (USD 40B) has fallen below the market value of its Bitcoin holdings (USD 50B). For bondholders, converting into stock at a negligible premium or a discount to NAV allows them to effectively acquire Bitcoin exposure at prices lower than the current spot market.
**2. The Four-Year Cycle Bottom** Bitcoin is currently trading near USD 69,000, roughly 45-52% below its October 2025 all-time high of USD 126,000. Analysts at Bernstein and Standard Chartered characterize this as a "mid-cycle correction" rather than a structural failure, predicting a rally to USD 150,000 before the end of 2026. Bondholders, who are capped on their returns via fixed coupons, have a massive incentive to convert into equity to capture the anticipated 2x-3x upside as the cycle resumes its upward trajectory.
**3. Macroeconomic Rotation: Gold to Bitcoin** Sophisticated institutional investors are beginning to encash profits from the 2025 Precious Metals rally (where gold surged 70% to top USD 5,000/oz) to rebalance toward Bitcoin. The BTC/Gold ratio has reached levels of underpricing not seen since 2015, signaling that Bitcoin is significantly mispriced relative to global liquidity. This rotation creates a "coiled spring" effect for MSTR equity, making the conversion of debt into shares a proactive move to capture institutional inflows.

## The Solvency Pillar: The USD 8,000 "Spent Cash" Scenario

The ultimate test of the STRC structural floor assumes a "Spent Cash" scenario: the USD 2.25 billion reserve is fully exhausted on 2.5 years of dividends, leaving USD 0 cash and a Bitcoin price of USD 8,000.

### The Post-Equitization Waterfall

Assuming the USD 6 billion in convertible debt is equitized as planned, the priority of claims in a liquidation event at USD 8,000 Bitcoin (USD 5.717 billion total asset value) is as follows:

| Layer | Priority | Redemption Value | Cumulative Claims | Coverage at USD 8k BTC |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Remaining Senior Debt** | 1 | ~USD 240 Million | USD 0.24 Billion | 100% |
| **STRF (Senior Preferred)** | 2A | ~USD 1.36 Billion | USD 1.60 Billion | 100% |
| **STRC (Subject Preferred)** | 2B | ~USD 3.40 Billion | USD 5.00 Billion | 100% |
| **Total Senior Claims** | -- | **USD 5.00 Billion** | -- | **Surplus: USD 717M** |
| Junior Preferred (STRK, STRD) | 3 | ~USD 2.78 Billion | USD 7.78 Billion | Nil/Partial |
| Common Stock (MSTR) | 4 | Residual | -- | Nil |

*Note: Based on total holdings of 714,644 BTC. Redemption values derived from Q4 2025 financials.*

### The Structural Break-Even Price

To identify the precise price at which Strategy Inc. could no longer cover the liquidation preference of the STRC shares, we calculate the "solvency floor" where asset value equals senior claims (Debt + STRF + STRC):
This mathematical floor of ~USD 7,000 implies that the STRC principal is 100% protected down to an USD 8,000 Bitcoin price, with a USD 717 million buffer still remaining at that level.

## STRC Performance and Stability Mechanisms

The STRC security is unique because its dividend rate is adjusted monthly to maintain its USD 100 par value. If the security trades below USD 95, Strategy Inc. raises the dividend (e.g., the recent hike from 11.00% to 11.25%) to incentivize buyers and return the price to par.
This mechanism ensures STRC behaves as a short-duration credit instrument rather than a volatile equity asset. It allows institutional holders to "strip away" Bitcoin's price volatility while collecting a high yield, provided the asset remains above the USD 7,000 structural floor.

## Conclusion

Strategy Inc. has architected a capital structure that remains solvent even under an 88% drawdown in Bitcoin prices. The combination of a massive, unencumbered 714,644 BTC treasury and a proactive 3-to-6-year equitization plan has created a mezzanine layer where the STRC principal is mathematically protected down to roughly USD 7,000 per Bitcoin. For sophisticated investors, the current market landscape—characterized by MSTR trading at a negligible premium and a broad rotation of profits from the Gold market back into digital assets—suggests that equitization is not just a defensive maneuver for the company, but an opportunistic one for creditors seeking to participate in the next leg of the Bitcoin four-year cycle.
