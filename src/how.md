This publication[^mission] is a collection of deep dives into various topics that have piqued my curiosity. It's a journey of exploration and learning, shared with you. This is a [clean internet](http://localhost:3000/how.html#clean-internet) publication.

# About "Deep Dive with Gemini" Podcast Research:

This podcast website hosts the open-source research and deep dives for the "deep dive with Gemini" show. We don't have a fixed schedule for new episodes. Instead, we follow an iterative approach to refine our research and insights. The idea is to revisit topics as many times as possible to uncover new insights. This process is repeated until the research converges and takes the shape of a well-formed episode. The journey of transformation from information to knowledge is captured in a git repository. The key is to iterate on the text. It doesn’t matter if the first draft was just a blank page, a copy from the web, or an AI-generated print. As we iterate, coherence improves, connections emerge, and there is always something new to capture.

## Clean internet

The way oceans are filled up with plastics, the internet is infected with countless cookies and trackers. Some of them useful for the functions of websites - but most to profile the users - to serve them pesky ads. Put together, they have turned the internet into a giant advertising billboard, if not a surveillance apparatus!

An immune response is the rise of freedom tech - privacy tools - VPNs, ad-blockers, encrypted chats, and scramblers. These tools are not only complicated, they make internet slow. My aspiration is to provide a reading experience as it was meant to be - Cookies free , Trackers free, Advertising free - without the reader having to use privacy crutches.

As a rule, and design imperative, I don't use any trackers or cookies whatsoever.

**The goal is NOT to fight ! Internet is too big to change and all models of content delivery may co-exist! It is only to do my part as a digital native - leave the place as clean as I found it.**

## Open source tools

Since a web browser is a general-purpose application, fine-tuning it for readability is somewhat of a necessity. I use an open-source publishing tool [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) to bind[^text] these pages into a book-like reading experience. The web app thus created has many features:

- It handles layout and responsive design, so my mind stays on the content - instead of technology.
- It keeps the essential book experience intact - even on a tablet or smartphone.
- The website may be installed like an app. Browser-based apps are called [progressive web apps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/What_is_a_progressive_web_app). They can be installed on computers or smart devices for offline reading.
- The app comes with a three-tier search - probably the least appreciated feature!

Content is written in Markdown on Vim - both open and time-tested. I mostly use Debian - a fully open distribution of Linux.

This means it is in the public domain, and you are free to share, adapt, and use it for any purpose. A copy of the license is also included in the `LICENSE` file in the project repository.

## Style and motivations:

- The content is designed for reading in a desktop or tablet[^tablet] browser.
- [Hyperlinks](https://shutri.com) are in "blue" color.
- Citations are in Footnotes[^foot] to improve the reader flow. They are hyperlinked.

## Tips and Donations:

Tips normally mean you are happy with your worker. Donations are something that show you support a cause. I may be wrong in my definitions - but you can't go wrong in supporting this work - either "tips" or "donations" - both are welcome. You can use the donation box below to send money in `Satoshies` - commonly called `Sats`. Sats are convenient because there is no credit card involved or computations for the exchange rates - it is one simple global money for the internet.

To send Sats with the above widget, you will need a "lightning wallet". Please visit [free lightning address](https://lightningaddress.com/) for a choice of wallets. Wallets are available for pretty much every platform and jurisdiction. They are extremely easy to install. One of the motivations of this publication is to promote the usage of Sats as a medium of monetary exchange.

## notes and other stuff:


[^mission]: This publication aspires to adhere to the original promise of the internet: A universally accessible, anonymous, and clutter-free way to communicate. The free internet is beautiful. It is the biggest library, and the web browser is the most used app. Some benefits of reading on the internet are:


[^text]: mdBook takes the written words in "markdown" format and churns out a fully deployable webApp.


[^tablet]: This content is “designed” for ‘in-browser’ reading experience on a laptop or a desktop. It should work pretty well on Tablets and Smartphones, even on a Kindle browser, but the mainstream browsers (Safari and Chrome) are purposefully kept dumbed down on smart devices. For one, you can't install extensions or "add-ons" on most browsers on smart(er) devices :-) I prefer [Kiwi](https://kiwibrowser.com/) Browser just because it allows me the ability to add extensions.


[^foot]: Footnote - When you click on the footnote marker in the main text, it brings you down to the relevant note at the bottom. You can always press the browser back arrow on your computer (or on a tablet) to get back to where you were reading or click on the curved arrow -->
