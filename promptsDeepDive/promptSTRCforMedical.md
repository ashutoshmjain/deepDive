Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro:

0:00 – 0:10  A single, intriguing question or paradox : What is the most pressing reality for a low income family particularly in California.
0:10 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer : Losing your health coverage under just because your income went slightly above the Medicaid limits ..
2:30 – 3:15 Welcome the listeners and express gratitude for amazing response. Share a story : what motivated us to do this episode on STRC again .. we mentioned in our last episode where we covered STRC and as a rock solid preferred ROC earning stock  - will share the link in description - .. In that episode we mentioned that STRC is a great opportunity of high income families - nearing retirement who want to defer their income .. or those white collar workers who fear AI for taking their jobs .. which brought in questions from many listeners as to " fine - that is good - but what exactly it means low income families  ... so that led to this episode where we want to venture into absolute basics - how STRC can really be a life saver when it comes to protecting medicaid plans in forty states ..but since every state has their own nuance, we picked California as a sample .. but again .. we wish we had the video for this episode cuz there is only so much we can communicate without visuals  .. and as you know we need to hit 1000 subscribers to get access to the funds for the Mosaic AI video editor which our marketing team is so appreciative of ... looks like they have figured out the holy grail of AI video editor ..all we need is your help .. please subscribe if you not already done and share the episode in your WhatsApp groups or wherever you geek out such topics of deep finance , deep science or deep spirituality ...
