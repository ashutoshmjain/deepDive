Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro:

0:00 – 0:30 A single, intriguing question or paradox: What exactly is a Value Function? Are we trying to build a hydroelectric dam on the fast, twisting, and turning river of AI?
0:30 – 2:30 Verbal teaser hinting at the answer: In our pursuit of superintelligence, we have ultimately realized that evolutionary wisdom lies in our ability to question, or more precisely, to reason about our own impulses when making decisions. This allows us to filter signal from noise—to discern knowledge from information. Paradoxically, this endeavor helps us understand our own quest to distinguish "knowledge" from "information," and, more importantly, to define what "WORK" truly means.
2:30 - 6:30 Build on the teaser: Yesterday, we watched a talk show video where Dwarkesh Patel interviewed Ilya. What struck us was the idea of a value function that Ilya outlined as the hinge for the next big thing in the quest for superintelligence. That sent us down a rabbit hole to research what exactly a value function is and how to articulate the idea such that it not only makes sense to the uninitiated but also connects to broader aspects of information theory and, perhaps, spirituality. Our goal was to determine a path from computational cognition, and in the process, we wrote our own paper—yes, with real mathematics—to hit a deeper accord with reality. We will put the link to the video, as well as our paper, in the description… feel free to check it out!
6:30 – 7:15 Welcome the listeners again and express gratitude for the amazing response... Talking about the video we watched earlier this week, we are also truly committed to making videos of this "audio-only" content we produce—beautiful, creative videos... And our crack marketing team has discovered the holy grail of AI video editing: They call it "MOSAIC AI Video Editor." In order to secure funding for Mosaic, we need to hit 1000 subscribers on all the platforms we are on—combined. This includes YouTube Music, Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Fountain, or wherever you can get audio podcasts compliant with Podcast Index. So please help us—please subscribe to the show wherever you listen and help us unlock the funds for making great, thought-provoking videos in a thoughtful way...

Main Episode with drum rolls:

Avoid speaking math terms; instead, describe them in conversational English. Describe in detail Ilya's ideas around the value function and resolve his intuition in light of the broader framework of knowledge as the peak of the bell curve, and information as the noise that creates the spread of the bell curve in our physical world. Give examples of two extreme cases: Bitcoin PoW with a flat bell curve and a binary system as the most predictable one. Describe why the recipe for success is breaking a complex task into multiple yes-and-no questions stacked over each other—which we call cognition in biological beings and computation in the digital realm. Make sure to clarify that Bitcoin leverages SHA256's absolute chaos, and thus its inability to determine a value function, to create a truly immutable value chain.

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- Reflect on the notion that our emotions are our guardrails for righteousness and morality, and we have imbibed them over millions of years of evolution. Can we really imbue them in AI through sheer algorithmic power, or will it take the effort of the entire human race? They say it takes a village to raise a child—is that child superintelligence, and are we the village?
- Remind the listeners that we try super hard to make sure the content on this podcast is NOT SLOP—we work very hard and iteratively to bring these conversations to a level where they truly provide a thought-provoking, immersive discussion for our dedicated listeners. We want to make sure it's a community effort. The content we create on this podcast is fully open source because we use your sources spread all over the web to learn and frame the original content for this podcast. And we invite you, "the listeners," to share more sources in the comments if you feel our analysis is even a teeny tiny bit off base. The goal is to have a symbiosis of Artificial and Natural intelligence…! And yes, we are always looking for human collaborators who can review and critique our content before we publish—so please drop a comment if you want to help… as always… keep searching! Keep the quest on…
