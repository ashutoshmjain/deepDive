Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro:

0:00 – 0:30  A single, intriguing question or paradox : What exactly is Value Function? Are we trying to build a hydro-electric dam on fast twisting and turning river of AI?
0:30 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer : In our pursit of super intelligence we have ultimately figured that evolutionary wisdom is in our ability to question or more precisely reason our own impulse to use brute force in decesions we take - thereby filtering signal from the noise - filtering knowledge from the information . Paradoxically this endevour helps us understand our own quest to distingiush "knowledge" from "information". And also - more importantly - define what exactly is the meaning of WORK . 
2:30 - 6:30  Build on the teaser : So yesterday we watched a talk show video where Dwarkesh Patel interviewed Ilya . What struck us was the idea of value function that Ilya outlined as to where the next big thing in quest of superintelligence is now hinged. That sent us down the rabbit hole to research what exactly is the value function and how do we articulate the idea such that it not only make sense to the uninitiated but also connect it to broader aspects of information theory and may be spirituality. Our goal was to determine a path from compution cognition and in the process we wrote  our own paper - yes with real mathematics - to hit a deeper accord with reality . We will put the link to video as well as our paper in the description ..feel free to check it out !
6:30 – 7:15 Welcome the listeners again and express gratitude for amazing response... Talking about the video we watched earlier this week , we also are truly commited to make Videos of this "audio only" content we produce - beautiful creative videos ... And our crack marketing team has figured the holy grail of AI video editing - They call it : "MOSAIC AI video editor".. In order to open the funding for Mosaic , we need to hit 1000 subscribers on all the platforms we are on - combined. Which includes youtube music , Spotify , Apple podcasts and Fountain or whereever you can get audio podcasts compliant with Podcast Index. So please help us - please subsrcibe to the show whereever you listen and help us unlock the funds for making great thought provoking videos in a thoughtful way ...

Main Episode with drum rolls :

Avoid speaking math terms - instead describe them in conversational English. Describe in detail the ideas of Ilya around value function and resolve his intuition in light of broader framework of knowledge as the peak of bell curve , information as the noise that creates the spread of bell curve in our physical world giving examples of two extreme cases - bitcoin PoW with flat bell curve and binary system as a most predictable one. Describe why the recipe to success is breaking a complex task into multiple yes and no questions stacked over each other - that we call cognition in case of biological beings and computation in case of digital realm. Make sure to clarify that bitcoin leverages SHA256's absolute chaos and hence inability to determine value function to create a true immutable value chain.

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- Reflect on the notion that our emotions are our guard rails for righteousness and for the morality and we have imbibed them over millions of years of evolution , can we really imbibe them in AI through sheer algorithmic power or will it take effort of entire human race - they say a it takes a village to raise a child - is that child super-intelligence and we are the village !
- Remind the listeners that we try super hard to make sure the content on this podcast is NOT SLOP - we work very hard and iteratively to bring these conversations to a level where they truly bring a thought provoking immersive discussion to the dedicated listeners we have and we want to make sure it is a community effort . The content we create on this podcast is fully open source because we use your sources spread all over the web to learn and frame the original content for this podcast. And we invite you "the listeners" to share more sources in the comments if you feel our analysis is even a teeny tiny off base. The goal is to have a symbiosis of Artificial and natural intelligence .....! And yes, we are always looking for human collaborators who could review and critique our content before we publish - so please drop a comment if you want to help .. as always .. keep searching ! Keep the quest on ..
