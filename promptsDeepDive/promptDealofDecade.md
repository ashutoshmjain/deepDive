Charming Intro: 

0:00 – 0:10  A single, intriguing question or paradox: How would you characterize the 'deal of the decade'—just the deal size in dollars, or the impact it is likely to have on the shape of our digital future?
0:10 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer: How the search, and now AI, deal between Cupertino and Mountain View has shaped our digital and, thus, real lives.
2:30 – 3:15 Welcome the listeners and express gratitude for the amazing response. Share a fun fact: we have completed 130 episodes, and our episode on the Boglehead retirement strategy received a special request for video. But here we have a chicken-and-egg situation. We are actively looking at the Mosaic AI video editor at https://mosaic.so/ to do the videos... but we need to reach 1000 subscribers to unlock the funds for fancy AI tools. So please share the show in your WhatsApp networks and help us grow the channel. And most importantly, hit that subscribe button.
