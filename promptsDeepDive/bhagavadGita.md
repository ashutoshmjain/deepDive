Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro:

0:00 – 0:30  A single, intriguing question or paradox : Why Bhagavad Gita is seen as the epitome of human wisdom. A a scripture written thousands of years back , still resonate with billions of people across the globe ? And not only spirituality , it holds tremendous weight in modern science !
0:30 – 4:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer : Provide quotes and citations from the most known people - be a scintist , philospopher , business leader or even a politician. How do they claim to have been influenced by the epic.
4:30 - 6:30 Bring the podcast "Bhagavad Gita - A poetic rendition" into focus that we did earlier this year. Explain the motivation - that there is so much written on Gita , we wanted to dive deeper chapter by chapter and verse by verse. Part of the problem that keeps Gita inaccessible to western audiences is constant switching between languages - from English to Sanskrit and to Hindi and back. The swiching tunes out most listeners. So we thought why not use AI to translate verses into English poetry and recite in native English. Startring with simple poetical translations in chapter one , we gradulated to William Shakespeare style hymns and beleive me into "Odes" in style of Keates. It was both a discovery of Bhagavad Gita on one side and English Poetry on the other.  Let the audience know to check out the description for link to the podcast we are talking about.
6:30 – 7:15 Welcome the listeners again and express gratitude for amazing response... well talking about what we want to do - our Karma Yoga- you know we want to make videos of this deep content ... remarkably vivid that truly envision the depth of spiritual as well as scientific teachings or epics like Gita or Plato's republic. We actually did an episode comparing the two very recently   .. and we really wish we had the AI video tools cuz there is only so much we can communicate without visuals  .. and as you know our constraint .. we need to hit 1000 subscribers to get access to the funds for the Mosaic AI video editor which our marketing team is so obsessed about  ... looks like they have figured out the holy grail of AI video editor ..all we need is your help .. please subscribe if you not already done and share the episode in your WhatsApp groups or wherever you geek out such topics of deep finance , deep science or deep spirituality ... Also please please let us know through comments if you know of an fully automated AI based video editor you think is better than Mosaic. You can check out Mosaic at https://mosaic.so .. that is MOSAIC.SO again 

Main Episode with drum rolls :

Present the podcast Episode as a stimulating conversation exploring the situation, core teachings, their comparison and connection with modern science and thought pulling all the sources together with primary focus on Karm yoga as this is kind of missing piece in most spiritual conversations. Yes devotion and meditation are core thesis but what Gita brings uniquely to the table is idea of Karmyoga.
