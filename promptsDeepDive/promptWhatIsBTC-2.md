Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro: 

0:00 – 0:10  A single, intriguing question or paradox: What exactly is a Bitcoin worth? What is the right value? I mean, let's say it takes 40,000 dollars to make a custom car, then sure, the fair value is 50 grand because the engineers need to have a good incentive... How would you give me the fair value of a Bitcoin?
0:10 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer: Well, the answer is actually very simple—all we need to do is figure out how much electricity and compute cost goes into minting a Bitcoin... but it is a unique 'car,' so to say... every ten minutes, let's say we make three-ish Bitcoins... but these Bitcoins progressively become harder to make—they need more work—which is kind of counterintuitive because with most products, say cars, things get easier to make as we hit mass manufacturing... in the case of Bitcoin... as we near the 21 million mark... it becomes almost impossibly harder to make one... it is kind of the reverse of the 'mass manufacturing concept,' but... let's still look under the hood to get you a fair value as of, say, yesterday... or this week...
2:30 – 3:15 Welcome the listeners and express gratitude for the amazing response. Share a story: what motivated us to do this episode on Bitcoin again... particularly 'What exactly is Bitcoin?' We mentioned in our last Bitcoin episode (we will share the link in the description) that Bitcoin is 1200 exahash and a trillion-dollar bug bounty... which brought in questions from many listeners as to, 'Fine, that is good, but what exactly does it mean from a fair value standpoint?'... so that led to this episode where we want to venture into the absolute basics... but again... we wish we had the video for this episode because there is only so much we can communicate without visuals. And as you know, we need to hit 1000 subscribers to get access to the funds for the Mosaic AI video editor, which our marketing team is so appreciative of... looks like they have figured out the holy grail of AI video editors... all we need is your help. Please subscribe if you have not already done so and share the episode in your WhatsApp groups or wherever you geek out on such topics of deep finance, deep science, or deep spirituality...

Main Episode with drum rolls:

Present the podcast episode in line with the source: The Miner's Equilibrium: Energy Arbitrage and the 50-Car Paradox.

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- I think the point we want to drive home is yes, we can give a fair value to Bitcoin, but that fair value is actually simply the value we humans, and the AI agents of the future, would want to store (and protect) on this foolproof, iron-clad, cryptographically secured network... The fair value of a Bitcoin is literally all the value we want to move to the future divided by 21 million... so there is no upper limit.
