Tone: Intriguing & Analytical

Charming Intro:

0:00 – 0:30 A single, intriguing question: What if a preferred stock, not a crypto token, became the most successful "corporate stablecoin" in history?

0:30 – 2:30 Verbal teaser hinting at the answer: We're talking about Strategy Inc.'s STRC, a preferred stock that has achieved something remarkable: liquidity and stability at a sovereign scale, even as the underlying Bitcoin and MSTR common stock are on a rollercoaster. How did they pull this off?

2:30 - 6:30 Build on the teaser: This isn't just about a successful financial instrument. It's about a company that is openly challenging the gatekeepers of traditional finance, like MSCI, and winning. They are rewriting the rules of corporate treasury in real-time.

As we noted January was a make or break month for the idea of digital credit. And we put on our "SEC filinigs Clerk" hats to go through all of the filings of Strategy inc - of course with pleasure of the fact at the back of our mind that our listeners love such type of forensic work. We though wish that we could present it in visuals . talking about visuals , you must have noticed that we have put out some test videos on youtube with simple infographics and cinematic captions. The point that we want to make is clear and simple " AI video editing" is NOT only for creating catchy meaningless "SHORTS" or clickbait deep fakes. We want to enusre that our content follows the same production standards that we so rigerously apply to our audio content . And that means we still need to hit 1000 subscribers on all our platforms - to get the funding for MOSAIC AI VIDEO EDITOR which everyone is talking about and more importantly to continue the deep dives. So please hit the subscribe button wherever you listen - youtube , youtube music, spotify , apple or fountain.fm - every single subscription counts towards our goal ..pleeeeseee ..

7:30 - 8:30 Links to References: Our STRC course on youtube is a super hit, thanks to you all spreading the word , will put a link in the description just in case you forward this episode in your whatsapp , signal , slack groups over whereever you geek out on this kinda of fintech , investing and soverign finance stuff.

Please talk to your CPA , investment advisors before you invest .. yes , you can sure send them this episode to refer to ..which we will love

Main Episode with drum rolls:

We'll break down how STRC's "Stretch" mechanism works, allowing it to maintain its USD100 peg with minimal volatility. We'll also dissect Strategy Inc.'s bold move to accelerate MSTR stock dilution right after MSCI's threats, and what this means for the future of "Digital Asset Treasury" companies. And finally, we'll get into the nitty-gritty of why we think STRC is a better buy than MSTR for most investors.

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- What does this all mean for the future of corporate finance? Are we seeing the birth of a new kind of financial instrument that bridges the gap between traditional finance and the world of digital assets?
