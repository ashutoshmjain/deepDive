Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro: 

0:00 – 0:10  A single, intriguing question or paradox: What is the most historic regulatory event in the history of digital money?
0:10 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer: A genius act, and we are looking at this historic event 90 days after—kinda like a 'Quarterly Report on Stable Dollars' and, more broadly, stablecoins in general!
2:30 – 3:15 Welcome the listeners and express gratitude for the amazing response. Share a story: as we have been saying on past shows, our crack marketing team is asking us to do videos—of course, using mosaic.so, the AI video editor we have been harping upon... but we turned the tide back to the marketing team. We asked them to create a sample video as to how it would look... so they came up with a seven-minute short video covering the content of this episode. We will drop the link in the description of this episode. It is NOT a finished product, but we would like to have your comments on how it came out. Does it pass the smell test? Where does it need more polish? And yes... our target is still 1000 subscribers to get you great video content.

Main Episode with drum rolls:

Present the podcast episode in line with the source: The Stablecoin Bifurcation: GENIUS Act Fallout.

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- I think the main takeaway is that stablecoins are doubling up the demand for US treasuries—first, the issues need one-on-one collateral, and second, the institutions are buying more treasuries with stable dollars in search of yield. Where does this leave stablecoins as opposed to the oppressive idea of CBDCs (central bank digital currencies)?
