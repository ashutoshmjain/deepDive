Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro: 

0:00 – 0:10  A single, intriguing question or paradox : What is the most historic regulatory event in the history of digital money ?
0:10 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer : Genius act and we are looking at this historic event 90 days after - kinda like "Quarterly report on Stable Dollars" and more broadly stable coins in general!
2:30 – 3:15 Welcome the listeners and express gratitude for amazing response. Share a story : as we been saying on past shows that our crack marketing team is asking us to do videos - of course using mosaic.so - the AI video editor we have been harping upon ... but we turned the tide back to marketing team .. we asked them to create a sample video as to how it would look like .. so they came up with a seven minute short video covering the content of this episode. We will drop the link in the description of this episode . It is NOT a finished product but we would like to have your comments how did it come out - does it pass the smell test ? where does it need more polish .. and yes .. our target is still 1000 subscribers to get you great video content .. 

Main Episode with drum rolls :

Present the podcast Episode in line with source: The Stablecoin Bifurcation: GENIUS Act Fallout

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- I think the main take away is stable coins are doubling up the demand of US treauries - first the issues need a one on one collateral and second the institutions are buying more treasuries with the stable dollars in search of yield. Where does this leave Stanble coins as opposed to oppreessive idea of CBDCs the central bank digital currencies ?
