Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro:

0:00 – 0:30  A single, intriguing question or paradox: AI is great—it is revolutionary tech—but... yes, there is always a but. Every time I want it to do something—maybe create an image or write an essay—it comes up with a totally new construct, and sometimes the polar opposite manifests. Why? The question is: Is the answer wrong, or am I asking the wrong question? The paradox is how to make it predictable without writing thousands of lines of code-esque prompts.
0:30 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer: Yes, prompt engineering is now a full-blown engineering discipline, and most of the future apps—AKA AI apps—are going to be sophisticated prompts. So today, we are going to show you how to write prompts. We are going to dive deep into prompt engineering frameworks, sometimes called 'Prompt Engineering 2.0,' but we are going to do it in a fun way. We are NOT explaining how to build a website or complex simulations or mathematical models... we are going to do it with something that we never expected from AI—a comedy, a funny story, a hyperbole, a TALL Tale! And we are going to use the metaphor of this tall tale. The goal is to look at the frameworks of PE 2.0 in light of something that all of us can relate to and something that sticks in our brains without having to do PhD-level research.
2:30 - 5:30  Build on the teaser: So the goal is to have AI create humor, but the thing about humor is that it is very complex. Why? Because humor is language-specific, it is place-specific... so the goal is to write a tall tale in South Asian culture in a language that has its own twists and turns—Urdu or maybe Hindi.
5:30 - 6:30 Set up the example: Because this is an English podcast, allow us to describe the story in English, but we will nail it down to the region and language as we progress in writing our prompt. Speak the story 'Shutosh's Buffalo' in ENGLISH—follow the source: 'Shutosha and the Marvelous Buffalo: A Hindi Tale.'
6:30 – 7:15 Welcome the listeners again and express gratitude for the amazing response... We truly wish we could show you the craft of prompt engineering—which we think is the future of creativity—in a beautiful, creative video... and we wish we had the AI video tools for this episode because there is only so much we can communicate with words. But we have a constraint... our hands are tied... well, our prompts are limited to the audio podcast only... and as you know, we need to hit 1000 subscribers to get access to the funds for the Mosaic AI video editor, which not only our crack marketing genius but many of our listeners have vouched for... looks like the Mosaic guys have figured out the holy grail of AI video editors... So here we are: all we need is your help. Please subscribe if you have not already done so and share the episode in your WhatsApp groups or wherever you geek out on such topics of AI, deep finance, deep science, or deep spirituality. Also, please, please let us know through comments if you know of a fully automated AI-based video editor you think is better than Mosaic. You can check out Mosaic at 'https://mosaic.so'... that is MOSAIC.SO again... and we will put a link in the description.

Main Episode with drum rolls:

Present the podcast episode as a stimulating conversation exploring the depths of every framework.
  - Explain how you would use different frameworks to create 'Shutosha's Buffalo,' a tall tale targeted for Hindi/Urdu audiences, baked in South Asian humor.
  - Explain the 'garbage in, garbage out' concept—why a correct prompt is a necessity for corporate environments, where the stakes are way higher than writing a comical tall tale.
  - Explain that large language models are probability machines—how they work and respond to human prompts.

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- Handle the problem of AI slop—explain why SLOP is way harder to prevent than SPAM because SLOP is not ill-intentioned... it is just an outcome of our human inability to command the most intelligent machine—AI—we have built on our collective intelligence.
- Remind the listeners that we try super hard to make sure the content on this podcast is NOT SLOP. We work very hard and iteratively to bring these conversations to a level where they truly bring a thought-provoking topic to the dedicated listeners we have, and we want to make sure it is a community effort. The content we create on this podcast is fully open-source because we use your sources spread all over the web to learn and frame the original content for this podcast. And we invite you, the listeners, to share more sources in the comments if you feel our analysis is even a teeny-tiny bit off-base. The goal is to have a symbiosis of artificial and natural intelligence! And yes, we are always looking for human collaborators who could review and critique our content before we publish—so please drop a comment if you want to help. As always, keep searching! Keep the quest on.
