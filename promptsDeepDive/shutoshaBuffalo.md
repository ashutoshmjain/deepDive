Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro:

0:00 – 0:30  A single, intriguing question or paradox : AI is great - it is revolutionary tech - but .. yes there is always a but .. every time I want it to do something - may be create an image or write an essay - it comes up with a totally new construct - and sometimes polar opposite manifests - why ? The question is : is the answer wrong or I am asking a wrong question ? The paradox is how to make it predictable without writing thousands of lines of code-esq prompts .. 
0:30 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer : Yes - prompt engineering is now a full blown Engineering dicipline and most of the future apps - aka AI apps are going to be sophisticated prompts. So today , we are going to show you how to write prompts. We are going to dive deep into prompt engineering frameworks sometimes called "Prompt Engineering 2.0" but we are going to do it in a fun way . We are NOT explaining how to build a website or complex simulations or mathematical models .. we are going to do it with something that we never expected from AI - a comedy - a funny story - a hyperbole - a TALL Tale ! And we are going to use the metaphore of this Tall tale. The goal is to look at frameworks of PE 2.0 in light of something that all of us could relate to and something that sticks in our brains without having to a PhD level research ...
2:30 - 5:30  Build on the teaser : So the goal is to have AI create humor but the thing about humor is , it is very complex . Why ? because humor is language specific , it is place specific .. so the goal is to write a Tall Tale in South Asian culture in a language that has its own twists and turns - Urdu or may be Hindi ..
5:30 - 6:30 Set up the example:  Because this is an English podcast , allow us to describe the story in English but we will nail it down to region and language as we progress to write our prompt. Speak the story "Shutosh's Buffalo" in ENGLISH - follow source : "Shutosha and the Marvelous Buffalo: A Hindi Tale"
6:30 – 7:15 Welcome the listeners again and express gratitude for amazing response... We truly wish we could show you the craft of Prompt Engineering - which we think is the future of creativity - in a beautiful creative video ... and we wish we had the AI video tools for this episode cuz there is only so much we can communicate with words - but we have a constrint .. our hands are tied ... well our prompts are limited to audio podcast only .. and as you know we need to hit 1000 subscribers to get access to the funds for the Mosaic AI video editor which not only our crack marketing genius but many of our listeners have vouched for ... looks like the Mosaic guys have figured out the holy grail of AI video editor ..So here we are : all we need is your help .. please subscribe if you not already done and share the episode in your WhatsApp groups or wherever you geek out such topics of AI  , deep finance , deep science or deep spirituality ... Also please please let us know through comments if you know of an fully automated AI based video editor you think is better than Mosaic. You can check out Mosaic at "https://mosaic.so" .. that is MOSAIC.SO again ..and we will put a link in the description.

Main Episode with drum rolls :

Present the podcast Episode as a stimulating conversation exploring the depths of every framework. 
  - Explain how would you use different frameworks to create "Shutosha's Buffalo" a tall tale targeted for Hindi / Urdu audiences baked in South Asian humor.
  - Explain garbage in a garbage out concept - why correct prompt is a necessity for corporate environments - stakes are way higher than writing a comical Tall tale.
  - Explain the Large language models are probability machines - how they work and respond to human prompts

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- Handle the problem of AI slop - explain why SLOP is way harder to prevent than SPAM because SLOP is not ill intentioned ... it is just an outcome of our human inability to comand the most intelligent machine AI we have built on our collective intelligence
- Remind the listeners that try super hard to make sure the content on this podcast is NOT SLOP - we work very hard and iteratively to bring these conversations to a level where they truly bring a thought provoking topic to the dedicated listeners we have and we want to make sure it is a community effort . The content we create on this podcast is fully open source because we use your sources spread all over the web to learn and frame the original content for this podcast. And we invite you the listeners to share more sources in the comments if you feel our analysis is even a teeny tiny off base. The goal is to have a symbiosis of Artificial and natural intelligence .....! And yes, we are always looking for human collaborators who could review and critique our content before we publish - so please drop a comment if you want to help .. as always .. keep searching ! Keep the quest on ..
