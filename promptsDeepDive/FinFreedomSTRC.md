Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro:

0:00 – 0:10  A single, intriguing question or paradox: Does financial freedom mean you must relocate to Nebraska?
0:10 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer: In this episode, we will show you how you can live in San Fran or Manhattan... with just a million dollars in the bank... well invested in STRC - an absolute life hack to get to your dreams... what you exactly want to do!
2:30 - 5:30  Explain what we are going to cover in this episode, urging the listeners to pay attention because it will get technical pretty soon. Identify three levers of arbitrage that we use to gain financial independence that the normal 4% rule would give at 2.5 million for financial independence. Stress that the idea here is not 'rest.' It is to unlock an opportunity... to unlock a window of ten years in this time when an entire new digital age is being built around Bitcoin and AI. This is by far the most opportune time to allow you to do what you exactly wanted to do with your life.
5:30 – 3:15 Welcome the listeners and express gratitude for the amazing response... well, talking about what you want to do raises a question - what we want to do... and you know we want to make videos of this deep content... remarkably vivid... and we wish we had the AI video tools for this episode because there is only so much we can communicate without visuals. And as you know, we need to hit 1000 subscribers to get access to the funds for the Mosaic AI video editor which our marketing team is so obsessed about... looks like they have figured out the holy grail of AI video editors... all we need is your help. Please subscribe if you have not already done so and share the episode in your WhatsApp groups or wherever you geek out on such topics of deep finance, deep science, or deep spirituality. Also, please, please let us know through comments if you know of a fully automated AI-based video editor you think is better than Mosaic. You can check out Mosaic at https://mosaic.so... that is MOSAIC.SO again.
