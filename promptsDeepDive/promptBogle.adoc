Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro: 

0:00 – 0:10  A single, intriguing question or paradox: What is the most brilliant piece of financial engineering the world has ever seen to date? Jack Bogle's index funds for absolute diversification, or Michael Saylor's STRC for absolute anti-diversification, just onto Bitcoin?
0:10 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer: STRC of Strategy Inc., which literally makes volatile Bitcoin into a steady stream of around ten percent tax-deferred dividends. And we will dive deep into what it means for the risk-averse retirement portfolio. Two things we want to focus on today: First, the standard, boring 60/40 portfolio which, to be frank, hasn't worked for the last decade; and second, the 'tax-deferred' nature of STRC dividends—which is very important if you are a salaried-class individual at the peak of your earnings nearing retirement in a high-income bracket. You want to defer your tax bills to maybe push them into your retirement, or those days when and if AI takes over your job :-), and how this single idea leads to an alternative modern portfolio that takes into account the permanent arrival of digital assets such as Bitcoin and many central banks capitalizing back onto gold. Sure, they are nowhere near replacing the mighty dollar, but no one can stop them from buying the yellow rock, and that impacts how you truly look at diversification.

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- If Bogle were alive today, how would he see Bitcoin as the emerging store of value, and how would he tweak his 60/40 concept in light of the emerging challenges to the mighty dollar?
- And within this message of ultimate financial engineering, turn to the financial engineering of our little show: Remind listeners once again to subscribe and spread the word so that we can buy the AI tool Mosaic video editor to create the video version of these episodes.
