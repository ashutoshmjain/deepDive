Tone: Intriguing & Analytical

Charming Intro:

0:00 – 0:30 A single, intriguing question: What if a company actively tries to reduce its share price - does the share price still counts as measure of success ? I mean the company is actively diluting its common stock - ha ha ha - then how do you measure the success - does it truly compares with any other equity on equity markets anyehere in the world or is a truly an inversion of shareholders from Speculators to investors :

0:30 – 2:30 Verbal teaser hinting at the answer: We're talking about Strategy Inc. (formerly MicroStrategy), a company that has been called a "Bitcoin Refinery". While traditional analysts see a "lost year" in the stock chart, a deeper look reveals a massive expansion of their Bitcoin treasury. Is the market missing the real story?

2:30 - 6:30 Build on the teaser: We'll deconstruct the "Saylor Premium", the "infinite money glitch", and how Strategy Inc. managed to increase its Bitcoin-per-share by over 23% while its stock price was cut in half. We'll explore the concept of "Bitcoin Yield" and why it might be a better way to measure corporate performance in the digital age.

Main Episode with drum rolls:

We'll dive deep into the numbers, comparing Strategy Inc.'s financial position in January 2025 to January 2026. We will discuss the "Scarcity Arbitrage" and why a bundle of Bitcoin is more valuable than a standalone coin. We will also contrast an investment in MSTR with a traditional equity like Apple, and explain why the speed of acquiring Bitcoin makes it a unique asset for corporate treasuries.

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- Reflect on the future: Is Strategy Inc. the model for a new type of corporation, one that prioritizes the accumulation of digital capital over nominal stock price fluctuations? What does this mean for the future of corporate finance and the role of Bitcoin in the global economy?
