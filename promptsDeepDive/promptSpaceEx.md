Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro: 

0:00 – 0:10  A single, intriguing question or paradox : Is space exploration inherently bad for the environment?
0:10 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer : Space Travel has found ways to be green friendly - not only as a good smaritan but out of necessity -  that is where Methalox comes into play and the idea that nuclear powered interplanetary ships must stay in the deep orbit , far away from earth's own atmosphere. Let the audience know that this episode is not mere repeat of what we already heard in popular media - it is a complete reimagination of whole 9 yards .. from environment challenges to regulatory concerns!
2:30 – 3:15 Welcome the listeners and express gratitude for amazing response. Share a fun a fact: that only 2 percent of our listeners are actually subscribing the show.  And that our crack marketig team is suggesting to create videos to gain more subs. But here we have a chicken and egg situation. We are actively looking at Mosaic AI video editor https://mosaic.so/ to do the videos ..but we need to reach 1000 subscribers to unlock the funds - for fancy AI tools .. So please share the show in your whatsapp networks and help us grow the channel. And most importantly hit that subscribe button.

Main Episode with drum rolls :

- AI has opened up the possibilities - not only obit managament or navigation but building  the interplanetary ships right there in the orbit. 
- Nuclear energy is clear winner for the inter planetary travel - for both slow moving cargo as well as the fast moving human ships
- And finally - Methalox is perfect substitute to jump out of the gravity wells instead of burning refined Kerosene.
- Cover the industry and economics of the model in full detail.

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- Imagine a future of green abundance for we can bring to home earth the things that are rare here but also we can spread the most important thing of all - the very life - to other planets .. and may be to other solar systems and who knows - to inter galactic depths - SKY IS NOT THE LIMIT any more !
- And with in this message of hope : Remind listeners once again to subscribe and spread the word so that we could buy AI tool Mosaic video editor to create the video version of these episodes . Mosaic makes the life really easy. All we need to do is feed our youtube podcast link to Mosaic and it automatically creates beautiful AI broll for the content, plus it is an ultimate tool for entire creative process automation .. we really want to do videos ... untill next time - imagine yourself on a space voyage .. Houston calling!
