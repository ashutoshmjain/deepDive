Tone: Intriguing & Analytical

Charming Intro:

0:00 – 0:30 A casual question: Hi all - did you hear Apple has started a new subscription? $12.99 for the entire creative suite, and that includes pro apps like Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage!

0:30 – 2:30 Verbal teaser hinting at the answer: Well, we know it's not something a normal person cares about, but we wanted to do an episode on this because it impacts small creators like us. We could suddenly have access to some of these pro applications, and we're wondering if we should get the suite, or is it just irrelevant in the AI era?

2:30 - 6:30 Build on the teaser: Is Apple just trying to start a price war with Adobe, or is this a much smarter play to become the go-to 'workbench' for creators in the AI age?

6:30 – 7:30 Subscription Request: While Apple's creative studio is a great opportunity that we are evaluating , you know , we need to hit 1000 subscribers for unloacking the funds ..so please subscribe if you already haven't on youtube , youtube music , apple podcasts , spotify and fountain.fm .. we love fountain.fm because fountain allows our listeners to boost the show with s low as 100 sats - that is a 10 cents .. a dime .. and at the same time , it lets the audience earn sats for listening to the show ... isn't that amazing ! that is the power of micropayments running on lightning network - not only does it open a direct to creator value for value model , it is an opportunity for listeners to experience lighning protocol !

7:30 - 8:30 Links to References: We did an episode, almost a month back on Apple and Google mega deal around Gemini .. this episode , in a way is the fallout of that "deal of decade" .. we will sure link the episode in description .

Main Episode with drum rolls:

We'll dig into Apple's strategy, from their unified codebase and hybrid AI to how this move frees up cash for creators to spend on generative AI tools like Mosaic and ElevenLabs. We'll also talk about the pressure this puts on Adobe and Blackmagic, and how Apple's hardware gives them a huge advantage.

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- So, what's the big picture here? Is Apple positioning itself to be the 'Operating System for AI'? We'll talk about how this could change the creative software market and what it means for the future of Apple's hardware.
