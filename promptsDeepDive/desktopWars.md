Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro:

0:00 – 0:30  A single, intriguing question or paradox : Is the desktop war over? For almost a decade we thought desktop is relegated to the past and the world had moved to smart phones or may be just the cost arbitrage of these uility devices - desktop or laptops or smartphones ! Did AI threw a ranch in that stable equilibrium ? 
0:30 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer : AI has overnight renewed the comptitive landscape. Microsoft can't rest on ubiquitous Windows any more and Mac has probably lost it's designer edge! But most importantly Linux , having captured the data centers is back in game. It is not challengig both Windows and Mac with sheer genius of Technical breaktroughs ..and well  .. a bit of compromise on FOSS philosophy ... yes we are talking about Ubuntu.. and whenever we utter the word Ubuntu , we need to talk about its mother ship - the grand old Purist - Debian.
2:30 - 5:30  Caution the audience that we are going to the very end of Technology in this episode. So if you are someone who doesn't really crave the jargon of computer's LA LA Land .. then may be you may consider skipping this one , though .. and it is a sincere  though .. we will try our best to make it a easy listen even if you think Chrome OS is the best value for money .. which is true if your goal is to watch youtube or check email .. and again ..no offense because we personally love Chrome OS for its cost effective and speed and battery .. all the things that a consumer machine needs. Okay ... Explain what we are going to cover in this episode urging the listeners to pay attention because it will get technical pretty soon. 
5:30 - 6:30 Refer to previous Episode where we discussed a modern portfolio theory v/s the bogleheads 40 : 60 . We will put the link in the description. The idea was to get a window of ten years of Financial Independece to do really focused development work .. may be at the intesection of bitcoin and AI .. So the goal here is really to consider our AI developer ..who is on a super tight budget and we want to do alleviate some pain from the first and foremost and most fundamental decesion - your desktop  .. Forget what you used in the hugh school or even college ..  this is the new world of AI .. with all that welcome to the DEEP Dive
6:30 – 7:15 Welcome the listeners again and express gratitude for amazing response... well talking about what we want to do with OUR desktops - what we want to do as your podcast hosts  .. you know we want to make videos of this deep content ... remarkably vivid .. and we wish we had the AI video tools for this episode cuz there is only so much we can communicate without visuals  .. and as you know our constraint .. we need to hit 1000 subscribers to get access to the funds for the Mosaic AI video editor which our marketing team is so obsessed about  ... looks like they have figured out the holy grail of AI video editor ..all we need is your help .. please subscribe if you not already done and share the episode in your WhatsApp groups or wherever you geek out such topics of deep finance , deep science or deep spirituality ... Also please please let us know through comments if you know of an fully automated AI based video editor you think is better than Mosaic. You can check out Mosaic at https://mosaic.so .. that is MOSAIC.SO again 

Main Episode with drum rolls :

Present the podcast Episode as a stimulating conversation exploring the depths of technology. Follow the script in source : destopWars.mp3 ; but not be limited to it. 

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- Do a final recommendation and cost analysis for our AI developer who has bet his life saving to realize this AI dream based on the source : Ubuntu AI Workstations Versus Apple Silicon for Cloud Deployment . Do menetion that we are heavily biased towards Linux because we use Debian for most our dev workflow and for this podcast we are testing WSL2 on Windows 11. 
- Remind the listeners that the content we create on this podcast is fully open source because we use your sources spread all over the web to learn and frame the original content for this podcast. And we invite you the listeners to share more sources in the comments if you feel our analysis is even a teeny tiny off base. The goal is to have a symbiosis of Artificial and natural intelligence .....!
