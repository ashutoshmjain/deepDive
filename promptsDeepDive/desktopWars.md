Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro:

0:00 – 0:30  A single, intriguing question or paradox: Are the desktop wars over? For almost a decade, we thought the desktop was relegated to the past and the world had moved to smartphones, or maybe it was just the cost arbitrage of these utility devices—desktops, laptops, or smartphones! Did AI throw a wrench in that stable equilibrium?
0:30 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer: AI has overnight renewed the competitive landscape. Microsoft can't rest on the ubiquitous Windows anymore, and Mac has probably lost its designer edge! But most importantly, Linux, having captured the data centers, is back in the game. It is now challenging both Windows and Mac with the sheer genius of technical breakthroughs... and well... a bit of a compromise on the FOSS philosophy... yes, we are talking about Ubuntu... and whenever we utter the word Ubuntu, we need to talk about its mothership—the grand old purist—Debian.
2:30 - 5:30  Caution the audience that we are going to the very depths of technology in this episode. So if you are someone who doesn't really crave the jargon of computer's La La Land... then maybe you may consider skipping this one, though... and it is a sincere thought... we will try our best to make it an easy listen, even if you think Chrome OS is the best value for money... which is true if your goal is to watch YouTube or check email... and again... no offense, because we personally love Chrome OS for its cost-effectiveness, speed, and battery... all the things that a consumer machine needs. Okay... Explain what we are going to cover in this episode, urging the listeners to pay attention because it will get technical pretty soon.
5:30 - 6:30 Refer to the previous episode where we discussed modern portfolio theory vs. the Bogleheads 40:60. We will put the link in the description. The idea was to get a window of ten years of financial independence to do really focused development work... maybe at the intersection of Bitcoin and AI. So the goal here is really to consider our AI developer... who is on a super tight budget, and we want to alleviate some pain from the first, foremost, and most fundamental decision—your desktop. Forget what you used in high school or even college... this is the new world of AI... with all that, welcome to The Deep Dive.
6:30 – 7:15 Welcome the listeners again and express gratitude for the amazing response... well, talking about what we want to do with OUR desktops - what we want to do as your podcast hosts... you know we want to make videos of this deep content... remarkably vivid... and we wish we had the AI video tools for this episode because there is only so much we can communicate without visuals. And as you know our constraint... we need to hit 1000 subscribers to get access to the funds for the Mosaic AI video editor which our marketing team is so obsessed about... looks like they have figured out the holy grail of AI video editors... all we need is your help. Please subscribe if you have not already done so and share the episode in your WhatsApp groups or wherever you geek out on such topics of deep finance, deep science, or deep spirituality. Also, please, please let us know through comments if you know of a fully automated AI-based video editor you think is better than Mosaic. You can check out Mosaic at https://mosaic.so... that is MOSAIC.SO again.

Main Episode with drum rolls:

Present the podcast episode as a stimulating conversation exploring the depths of technology. Follow the script in the source: desktopWars.mp3, but do not be limited to it.

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- Do a final recommendation and cost analysis for our AI developer who has bet his life savings to realize this AI dream, based on the source: Ubuntu AI Workstations Versus Apple Silicon for Cloud Deployment. Do mention that we are heavily biased towards Linux because we use Debian for most of our dev workflow, and for this podcast, we are testing WSL2 on Windows 11.
- Remind the listeners that the content we create on this podcast is fully open source because we use your sources spread all over the web to learn and frame the original content for this podcast. And we invite you, the listeners, to share more sources in the comments if you feel our analysis is even a teeny-tiny bit off base. The goal is to have a symbiosis of artificial and natural intelligence! And yes, we are always looking for human collaborators who could review and critique our content before we publish—so please drop a comment if you want to help. As always, keep searching! Keep the quest on.
