# content

 Look at the source "Gauge Groups and the Origin of Mass" . Create the first of the three video mini series. 


# Target audience 

high school level. Avoid using too much mathematics. Present concepts.

# Video Style

- Don't put a border on slides. Let it be an open canvas.
- Let the background be visible under the slides content
- Use Pencil art sketches with different color shades to express the ideas.

## Audio style

- Avoid speaking mathematics terms even if they are there on the slides. The idea is students should be able to listen to it as a simple podcast even if they are not looking at screen.
- Repeat the key concepts
- Ask intelligent questions (to students) to check if the ideas are clear. Give a pause and then provide the answer.
