2:30 – 3:15 Welcome the listeners and express gratitude for the amazing response. Share a fun fact: only 2 percent of our listeners are actually subscribing to the show. And our crack marketing team is suggesting creating videos to gain more subs. But here we have a chicken-and-egg situation. We are actively looking at the Mosaic AI video editor at https://mosaic.so/ to do the videos... but we need to reach 1000 subscribers to unlock the funds for fancy AI tools. So please share the show in your WhatsApp networks and help us grow the channel. And most importantly, hit that subscribe button.
