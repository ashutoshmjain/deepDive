Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro: 

0:00 – 0:10  A single, intriguing question or paradox : What is the most brilliant piece of financial engineering world has ever seen to date ..which is of course not a pozi scheme.
0:10 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer : STRC of Strategy inc which literally makes volotile Bitcoin into a steady stream around of ten percent tax deferred dividends. And we will dive deep into the latest updates on STRC right from yesterday's Q3 earning call. Two things we want to focus today : First - Michael Saylor's big claim that STRC is protected even if bitcoin draws down by say 80 percent ; and second the "Tax deferred " nature of STRC dividends - which is very important if you are salaried class in high income bracket - you want to defer your tax bills to may be push into the retirement times or those days when and if AI takes over your job :-) 
2:30 – 3:15 Welcome the listeners and express gratitude for amazing response. Share a fun a fact: that only 2 percent of our listeners are actually subscribing the show.

Main Episode with drum rolls :

- Demystify the 80 percent draw down claim. Is it really true ?
- Explain what is meant by ROC - return on capital and what is the tax treatment of STRC dividends - explain in ful details as to who is reponsible for maintaining the correct cost basis to report if and when you sell your position
- Articulate how strpping away volatility in instruments like STRC is making MSTR even more volatile. Explain what does it mean when people say it is a call option on bitcoin.

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- What if MSTR locks 50,000 bitcoin with say stretegic bitcoin reserve with a pledge from US Gov to perpetually cover STRC dividends, does it turn into perpetual government security like a super long term T bill with super yield - question for every one to think about.
- And with in this message of ultimate financial enginnering - turn to the financial engieering of our little show : Remind listeners once again to subscribe and spread the word so that we could buy AI tool Mosaic video editor to create the video version of these episodes .
