Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro: 

0:00 – 0:10  A single, intriguing question or paradox: What is the most brilliant piece of financial engineering the world has ever seen to date... which is, of course, not a Ponzi scheme?
0:10 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer: STRC of Strategy Inc., which literally makes volatile Bitcoin into a steady stream of around ten percent tax-deferred dividends. And we will dive deep into the latest updates on STRC right from yesterday's Q3 earnings call. Two things we want to focus on today: First, Michael Saylor's big claim that STRC is protected even if Bitcoin draws down by, say, 80 percent; and second, the 'tax-deferred' nature of STRC dividends—which is very important if you are a salaried class in a high-income bracket. You want to defer your tax bills to maybe push them into your retirement, or those days when and if AI takes over your job. :-)
2:30 – 3:15 Welcome the listeners and express gratitude for the amazing response. Share a fun fact: only 2 percent of our listeners are actually subscribing to the show. And our crack marketing team is suggesting creating videos to gain more subs. But here we have a chicken-and-egg situation. We are actively looking at the Mosaic AI video editor at https://mosaic.so/ to do the videos... but we need to reach 1000 subscribers to unlock the funds for fancy AI tools. So please share the show in your WhatsApp networks and help us grow the channel. And most importantly, hit that subscribe button.

Main Episode with drum rolls:

- Demystify the 80 percent drawdown claim. Is it really true?
- Explain what is meant by ROC (Return on Capital) and what is the tax treatment of STRC dividends. Explain in full detail who is responsible for maintaining the correct cost basis to report if and when you sell your position.
- Articulate how stripping away volatility in instruments like STRC is making MSTR even more volatile. Explain what it means when people say it is a call option on Bitcoin.

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- What if MSTR locks 50,000 Bitcoin with, say, a strategic Bitcoin reserve with a pledge from the US government to perpetually cover STRC dividends? Does it turn into a perpetual government security like a super long-term T-bill with a super yield? A question for everyone to think about.
- And within this message of ultimate financial engineering, turn to the financial engineering of our little show: Remind listeners once again to subscribe and spread the word so that we can buy the AI tool Mosaic video editor to create the video version of these episodes. Mosaic makes life really easy.
