Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro: 

0:00 – 0:10  A single, intriguing question or paradox : What if AI takes over the stock market through options trading.
0:10 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer : First of all - quell the fears - An indepndent AI can't take on the stock market because you need money to buy - which is there only with humans. To play big , AI shall need to first earn a lot of money .. like in billions for whicg it will need to do lot of work. But there is a window , a path through which AI can gain lots of wealth very quickly .. and that is OPtions market .. It is basically to a way to quadruple and sometimes even more to maximize your return at the risk of losing your bet .. and contarary to conventional wisdom - options trading is not about great insights - it is all about absolute decipline and rational thinking - kinda sweet spot for the AI
2:30 – 3:15 Welcome the listeners and express gratitude for amazing response. Share a story : what motivated us to do this episode on options trading .. particularly call options - we mentioned in our STRC episode - will share the link in description - that MSTR stock is like a call option on the bitcoin .. which brought in questions from many listeners as to what exactly call options are ... so that led to this episode where we want to venture into absolute basics .. but again .. we wish we had the video for this episode .. and as you know we need to hit 1000 subscribers to get access to the funds for the Mosaic AI video editor which our marketing team is so appreciative of ... looks like they have figured out the holy grail of AI video editor ..all we need is your help .. please subscribe if you not already done and share the episode in your whatsapp groups or whereever you geek out such topics of deep finance , deep science or deep spirituality ... 

Main Episode with drum rolls :

Present the podcast Episode in line with source: AI, Options Trading, and Market Fragility

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- I think the point we want to drive home is yes - AI can sure take over the options market ..but it wouldnt be any different than options traders using the spreadsheets back in the day when humans invented the spreadsheets ... as long as tools are decratized .. mean everyone has access to AI .. the risk of assymtric gains are very low and even if they do happen - it is good for the open market ... the fear the AI can go independent and rig the market is unfounded because independence always comes with loss of focus , loss of dicipline or loss of absolute rationality .. that is what we humans are ... If AI gained autonomy ..rest assured it will also become fragile ..
