Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro: 

0:00 – 0:10  A single, intriguing question or paradox: What if AI takes over the stock market through options trading?
0:10 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer: First of all, quell the fears. An independent AI can't take on the stock market because you need money to buy, which is something only humans have. To play big, AI will need to first earn a lot of money... like in the billions, for which it will need to do a lot of work. But there is a window, a path through which AI can gain a lot of wealth very quickly... and that is the options market. It is basically a way to quadruple and sometimes even more, to maximize your return at the risk of losing your bet... and contrary to conventional wisdom, options trading is not about great insights—it is all about absolute discipline and rational thinking—kinda a sweet spot for AI.
2:30 – 3:15 Welcome the listeners and express gratitude for the amazing response. Share a story: what motivated us to do this episode on options trading... particularly call options. We mentioned in our STRC episode (we will share the link in the description) that MSTR stock is like a call option on Bitcoin, which brought in questions from many listeners as to what exactly call options are... so that led to this episode where we want to venture into the absolute basics... but again... we wish we had the video for this episode... and as you know, we need to hit 1000 subscribers to get access to the funds for the Mosaic AI video editor, which our marketing team is so appreciative of... looks like they have figured out the holy grail of AI video editors... all we need is your help. Please subscribe if you have not already done so and share the episode in your WhatsApp groups or wherever you geek out on such topics of deep finance, deep science, or deep spirituality...

Main Episode with drum rolls:

Present the podcast episode in line with the source: AI, Options Trading, and Market Fragility.

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- I think the point we want to drive home is yes, AI can surely take over the options market... but it wouldn't be any different than options traders using spreadsheets back in the day when humans invented spreadsheets... as long as tools are democratized... meaning everyone has access to AI... the risk of asymmetric gains is very low, and even if they do happen, it is good for the open market... The fear that AI can go independent and rig the market is unfounded because independence always comes with a loss of focus, a loss of discipline, or a loss of absolute rationality... that is what we humans are... If AI gained autonomy, rest assured it will also become fragile.
