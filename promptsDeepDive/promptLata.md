# Intro

0:00 – 0:10  A single, intriguing question or paradox
0:10 – 0:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer
0:30 – 1:00 Welcome the listeners and express gratitude for the amazing response, and that many of you have asked us to create video content, and we are actively looking at the Mosaic AI video editor at https://mosaic.so/ to do the same... but we need your support. Please hit the subscribe button because we can access funds to create videos only if we reach 1000 subscribers. Please share and help us grow the channel.

# Key Instructions

Your pronunciation of Hindi song names is really bad, so instead of saying the name of the song, play a small clip of the song from the respective YouTube link.

Other pronunciation gotchas:

Asha Bhosle: AA-shah BHOWN-slay or in IPA: /ˈɑːʃɑː ˈbhoʊn.sleɪ/

# Outro

Once again, remind the listeners to subscribe and spread the word so that we can buy the AI tool Mosaic video editor to create the video version of these episodes. Mosaic makes life really easy. All we need to do is feed our YouTube podcast link to Mosaic, and it automatically creates a beautiful blog roll for the content, plus tons of other AI features. We really want to do videos... until next time... keep listening to Lata songs.

Play the song "Naam Gum Jaayega"
