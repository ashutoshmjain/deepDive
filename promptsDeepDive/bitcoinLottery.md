Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro:

0:00 – 0:30  A single, intriguing question or paradox: What is the most relevant customer cohort for Bitcoin?
0:30 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer: No, it is not the strategic Bitcoin reserve or the sovereigns! Neither is it the IRAs or ROTHs where people may plan to invest a tiny percentage in Bitcoin. What if we told you that the most relevant cohort for Bitcoin is lottery ticket buyers! Yes, lottery players who spend five to ten dollars every week—tiny amounts without expectations of any real return. Would you call us crazy? No, don't tune out, because by the end of this episode, you will know that Bitcoin is actually the biggest lottery, and we promise every player will get 10x returns... though there is one condition: every lottery buyer will need to commit to the plan. It is a plan where birds can literally fly away with the entire net cast to trap them.
2:30 - 5:30  Build on the teaser: Lottery sales in the US alone are a whopping 113 billion dollars a year. Yes, let it sink in—113 billion dollars. This is bigger than all the streaming services' revenue and concert ticket sales... COMBINED. And the beauty of this cohort is they are already committed to losing their money. At the very outset, there is no expectation of gain. And even better, it is good Karma, because the model stems from changing a flashy, impulsive spender into a consistent saver betting on the hardest, most scarce, most liquid, and most divisible asset the human race has seen to date. Besides, it puts the asset into the hands of people—real, ordinary people where it belongs. In this episode, we will mathematically show you how we promise a minimum ten times (10x) return on every single lottery ticket bought, because if every single player played their bet on Bitcoin, within ONE YEAR, the Bitcoin price could—in an optimistic scenario—reach 900K, well close enough, which is a ten times gain from the current price of, say, 90K per coin. 
5:30 - 6:30 Call to action: So here is our call to action: to every Bitcoin influencer, to every HODLer, and to everyone who wants Bitcoin to reach beyond the shackles of corporate treasuries or sovereign wealth funds, or the ones waiting on governments to start strategic Bitcoin reserves, please listen and spread the word. DON'T go after Gold because central banks can't change overnight. Rather, seek help from those who already know how to bet and play—the lottery players—and see the Bitcoin market cap beating that of GOLD within ONE SINGLE year!
6:30 – 7:15 Welcome the listeners again and express gratitude for the amazing response... well, talking about our own "call to action," we want to make videos with beautiful visuals of this deep content... remarkably vivid... and we wish we had the AI video tools for this episode because there is only so much we can communicate with words—the complex mathematical models. And as you know our constraint... we need to hit 1000 subscribers to get access to the funds for the Mosaic AI video editor which our marketing team is so obsessed about... looks like they have figured out the holy grail of AI video editors... all we need is your help. Please subscribe if you have not already done so and share the episode in your WhatsApp groups or wherever you geek out on such topics of Bitcoin, deep finance, deep science, or deep spirituality. Also, please, please let us know through comments if you know of a fully automated AI-based video editor you think is better than Mosaic. You can check out Mosaic at https://mosaic.so... that is MOSAIC.SO again.

Main Episode with drum rolls:

Present the podcast episode as a stimulating conversation exploring the depths of the argument and the math. Follow the script in the source: bitcoinLottery.mp3, but do not be limited to it—let the imagination fly because it is good Karma. We want people to listen to this episode spellbound, like a magic show. :-)

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- Do a final recall of the "call to action". suggest an alternating habit: buy a lottery ticket one week and use maybe Cash App to buy tiny amounts of Bitcoin the other week and compare which bet is making them more money
