Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro:

0:00 – 0:30  A single, intriguing question or paradox : What is the most relevant customer cohort for bitcoin ?
0:30 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer : No it is not Stretgic bitcoin reserve or the soverigns! Neither is it the IRAs or ROTHs where people may plan to invest a tiny percentage in bitcoin. What if we told you that the most relevant cohort for bitcoin is the Lottery tickets buyers ! Yes lottery players who spend five to ten dollars every week - tiny amounts without expectations of any real return .. would you call us crazy ? No do't tune out because by the end of this episode, you will know that bitcoin is actually the biggest lottery and we promise every player will get 10x returns .. though there is one condition - every lottery buyer will need to commit to the plan . It is a plan where birds can literally fly away with entire net cast to trap them.
2:30 - 5:30  Build on the teaser : Lottery sales in US alone are whopping 113 billion dollars a year. Yes - let it sync in - 113 billion dollars. This is bigger than all the streaming services' revenue and concerts tickets sales ... COMBINED. And the beauty of this cohort is they are anyway commited to lose their money. At the very outset there is no expecations of gain. And even better - it is a good Karma - because the model stems on changing a flashy impulsive spender into consistent saver betting into the hardest and most scarce and most liquid and most divisible asset human race has seen to date. Besides it puts the asset into the hands of people - Real ordinary people where it belongs. In this episode, we will mathematically show you how we promise minimum ten times (10x) return to every single lottery ticket bought because if every single player played their bet on bitcoin, with in ONE YEAR - bitcoin price can - in a optimistic scenario - reach a 900 K - well close enough - which is ten times gain from current price of say 90 K per coin. 
5:30 - 6:30 Call to action :  So here is our call to action - to every bitcoin influencer - to every HODL and to everyone who want bitcoin to reach beyond shackles of corporate treasuries or soverign wealth funds or the ones waiting on govs to start stretegic bitcoin reserves - please listen and spread the word. DONT go after Gold because central banks can't change overnight - rather seek help from those who already know how to bet and play - the lottry players - and see bitcoin market cap beating that of GOLD with in ONE SINGLE year !
