Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro:

0:00 – 0:10  A single, intriguing question or paradox: What is the most astonishing coincidence?
0:10 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer: Two epics—the Bhagavad Gita and Plato's Republic—thousands of miles and centuries apart in space and time, resonate so well with each other.
2:30 – 3:15 Welcome the listeners and express gratitude for the amazing response. Share a story: The way Ved Vyasa, the author of the epic Mahabharata, and Plato, the writer of The Republic, visualized reality is remarkably vivid, and we wish we had the video for this episode because there is only so much we can communicate without visuals. And as you know, we need to hit 1000 subscribers to get access to the funds for the Mosaic AI video editor which our marketing team is so obsessed about... looks like they have figured out the holy grail of AI video editors... all we need is your help. Please subscribe if you have not already done so and share the episode in your WhatsApp groups or wherever you geek out on such topics of deep finance, deep science, or deep spirituality. Also, please, please let us know through comments if you know of a fully automated AI-based video editor you think is better than Mosaic. You can check out Mosaic at https://mosaic.so... that is MOSAIC.SO again.
