Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro: 

0:00 – 0:10  A single, intriguing question or paradox : With so many possibilities in designing a developer workflow thanks to AI , how do you pivot to suit one to your garage team of afterhour developers - the band of cypherpunks degens!
0:10 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer : The future of developers is small teams solving community problems. Sure the Microsofts and google's of the world would continue big but if AI is destined to solve real world problems then the future is the hands of small teams of humans passionate to solve real world problems that matter to them and their communities. Good news is - with AI , it is no longer a pipe dream to build a flexi eduction system for your school or to automate the checkout process for the Farmers market. Even you DMV can use your help to move away from number plates and start recognozing VIN number of your car as the sole identifictaion - why not ? At least you can ask the question ... 
2:30 – 3:15 Welcome the listeners and express gratitude for amazing response respnse to our last episode on Strategy Inc 's Q3 report focusing on STRC - people have asked many question which we will address in our next episode on worderful world of engineered finance but before we do that here is a question to our listers - what do we mean when we say we have looked at your sources - it means we go through hundreds of websites before puttting together  these episode and we request you to share in cmments if you believe we missed some critical piece of information.

Main Episode with drum rolls :

A tool chain strategy for a small human team augmented with AI ... along following lines : 

1) Pure punk approach : hybrid model with Ollama and self hosted LLMs is great but let's face it , you want to focus on your goal ..not open another AI lab ..but if you are interested we will cover it last 

2) Ninja group : Get up and done fast - Cursor or co piolet approach you lockin at IDE level but you keep an option to hit the best LLM for the job.

3) Purist sage : One LLM one CLI - direct CLIs to main LLM providers - compare Gemini CLI with codex and Claude code - try to make clear recommendations 

4) Pure Punk in detail : cover the best strategy - hybrid - 70 billion parameters self hosted or in regular cloud and use cloud LLMs for surgical usage ..Go in complete depth.
