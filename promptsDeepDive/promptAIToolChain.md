Tone: Inspiring

Charming Intro: 

0:00 – 0:10  A single, intriguing question or paradox: With so many possibilities in designing a developer workflow thanks to AI, how do you pivot to suit one to your garage team of after-hour developers—the band of cypherpunk degens!
0:10 – 2:30  Verbal teaser hinting at the answer: The future of development is small teams solving community problems. Sure, the Microsofts and Googles of the world will continue to be big, but if AI is destined to solve real-world problems, then the future is in the hands of small teams of humans passionate about solving real-world problems that matter to them and their communities. The good news is, with AI, it is no longer a pipe dream to build a flexi-education system for your school or to automate the checkout process for the farmers market. Even your DMV can use your help to move away from license plates and start recognizing the VIN of your car as the sole identification—why not? At least you can ask the question... 
2:30 – 3:15 Welcome the listeners and express gratitude for the amazing response to our last episode on Strategy Inc.'s Q3 report focusing on STRC. People have asked many questions which we will address in our next episode on the wonderful world of engineered finance, but before we do that, here is a question for our listeners: what do we mean when we say we have looked at your sources? It means we go through hundreds of websites before putting together these episodes, and we request you to share in the comments if you believe we missed some critical piece of information. If you give us a web link to your ideas, we will make sure to research that and cover it as a small addendum episode. And by the way... we are actively looking at the Mosaic AI video editor at https://mosaic.so/ to create videos... but we need to reach 1000 subscribers to unlock the funds for fancy AI tools. So please share the show in your WhatsApp networks and help us grow the channel. And most importantly, hit that subscribe button.

Main Episode with drum rolls:

A toolchain strategy for a small human team augmented with AI... along the following lines:

1) Pure punk approach: A hybrid model with Ollama and self-hosted LLMs is great, but let's face it, you want to focus on your goal... not open another AI lab... but if you are interested, we will cover it last.

2) Ninja group: Get up and running fast—Cursor or Copilot approach. You lock in at the IDE level but you keep an option to hit the best LLM for the job.

3) Purist sage: One LLM, one CLI—direct CLIs to main LLM providers. Compare Gemini CLI with Codex and Claude code. Try to make clear recommendations.

4) Pure punk in detail: Cover the best strategy—hybrid—70 billion parameters self-hosted or in the regular cloud and use cloud LLMs for surgical usage. Go in complete depth.

Closing to leave a lasting thought:

- Will you start seeing developer gangs at a farmers market or community 'Music in the Park' events... there not to sing but to learn what people want solved in real life?
- And within this message of ultimate community, turn to the community we have been building for our little show. We welcome your comments, your sources for research, and most importantly, you subscribing to the show. And if you subscribe and spread the word, we can buy the AI tool Mosaic video editor to create the video version of these episodes. Mosaic makes life really easy. All we need to do is feed our YouTube podcast link to Mosaic, and it automatically creates beautiful AI b-roll for the content, plus it is an ultimate tool for the entire creative process automation... we really want to do videos... until next time, keep searching!
