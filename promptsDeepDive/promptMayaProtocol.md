# Outro

Once again, remind the listeners to subscribe and spread the word so that we can buy the AI tool Mosaic video editor to create the video version of these episodes. Mosaic makes life really easy. All we need to do is feed our YouTube podcast link to Mosaic, and it automatically creates a beautiful blog roll for the content, plus tons of other AI features. We really want to do videos... until next time... keep listening to Lata songs.
